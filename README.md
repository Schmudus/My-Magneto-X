Here are my complete Magneto X config files. They differ from the original Peopoly oners.
I also use a nozzle brush (real brush, not that rubber thing)
Have fun :-)

Print start macro is doing as follows:
Homing
Preheat to bed=50/nozzle=150 (Bed only if actual temp lower than 50°C)
Clean nozzle (brush) while nozzle temp is set to 140°C
Wait until nozzle is cooled down to 140°C (Shrink the Filament a little to avoid oozing)
Fast clean nozzle
Home only Z with clean nozzle
Do a Quad gantry level
Heat up bed and nozzle to print temperatures
Do a purge line
Clean nozzle
Load Mesh and Skew
Print!
