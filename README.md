Here are my complete Magneto X config files. They differ from the original Peopoly oners.
I also use a nozzle brush (real brush, not that rubber thing)
Have fun :-)

Print start macro (Standard/PLA, PETG, ...)is doing as follows:<br>
Homing<br>
Preheat to bed=50/nozzle=150 (Bed only if actual temp lower than 50°C)<br>
Clean nozzle (brush) while nozzle temp is set to 140°C<br>
Wait until nozzle is cooled down to 140°C (Shrink the Filament a little to avoid oozing)<br>
Fast clean nozzle<br>
Home only Z with clean nozzle<br>
Do a Quad gantry level<br>
Heat up bed and nozzle to print temperatures<br>
Do a purge line<br>
Clean nozzle<br>
Load Mesh and Skew<br>
Print!<br>

---- UPDATE 2024-10-30 ----<br>
Changed extruder motor to a much stroonger one to get rid of the extruder skiping.<br>
<br>
Added my own designed and printed parts<br>
